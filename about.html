    What are mobile websites?
And a separate site built specifically for mobile devices, which typically is found at a URL like m.yourwebsite.com or yourwebsite.com/mobile. Visitors are automatically redirected to the appropriate website based on the type of device they are using (e.g., an iPhone or a Dell laptop).
